# Starting-line
The beginning 
I want to start a website, an online boutique of sorts that women, and men of course, can share inspirational words, ask questions of the community,  browse hand selected different gifts and crafts, start and join book clubs, a low maintenance set-up that I can work. I'm only just starting out but I am able and willing to learn as much as I can absorb
